**1)**  #MINIMAL++
In the directory Programming L. you will find a project which implements my own programming language minimal++.The programm was made with python and it has some characteristics.**First one** is that you can write any programm you want in a file ending with .min ,  then my compiler(minimal++) compiles it and shows you if you have any error according to the instructions on which the language was built .**Second** is that minimal++ compiler appears 3 files where in the first one you can see the steps of the compiler **(.int file shows you that)**.Furthermore you can see a **(.c)** file that converts the programm of minimall++ into **c** programm and finaly has a **(.asm)** file that converts also the current programm to **assembly** file.All the files and examples that I mentioned before , you can find them in folder Programming L.
