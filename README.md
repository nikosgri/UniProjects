# UniProjects

**1)**  
In the directory Programming L. you will find a project which implements my own programming language minimal++.The programm was made with python and it has some characteristics.**First one** is that you can write any programm you want in a file ending with .min ,  then my compiler(minimal++) compiles it and shows you if you have any error according to the instructions on which the language was built .**Second** is that minimal++ compiler appears 3 files where in the first one you can see the steps of the compiler **(.int file shows you that)**.Furthermore you can see a **(.c)** file that converts the programm of minimall++ into **c** programm and finaly has a **(.asm)** file that converts also the current programm to **assembly** file.All the files and examples that I mentioned before , you can find them in folder Programming L. 

**2)**
 The second project was built with java .It is a Text to Speech programm where when you run the application of this you can open an existing document , edit eny document and create your own as well.It allows you to save at your computer files your document and with the right command whatever your document has, it converts it into speech.Furthermore you have a lot of option such that you can choose any line you want and the programm will convert only this line into speech  .Also gives you the ability if you want it to start converting your text upside down and you also have the ability to select which line you want and convert it upside down as well.
